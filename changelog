* added new-style weewx logging with fallback to old-style logging
* changed the storage of frequency errors per transmitter (for EU systems only)
    with fallback for use with rtldavis versions v12 and earlier
* added the handling of New Zealand stations via parameter '-tf NZ'

* fixed: self.rain_per_tip is now 0.254 inch for bucket_type 0; 
    thanks to Paul Anderson for detecting this bug
* cleaned up coding
* removed parameters log_unknown_sensors and log_unmapped_sensors
* added parameter save_pct_good_per_transmitter; default is False
* saving frequency errors of first 5 frequencies now limited to EU band
* pct_good of transmitter 1 is not saved when we have only one transmitter
    because pct_good_0 is the same as pct_good_all
* the mapping of pct_good per channel is now controlled by the DEFAULT_SENSOR_MAP
    note: the mapping of pct_good_all remains hardcoded mapped to rxCheckPercent
* added debug logging for raw humidity data; default: no logging
